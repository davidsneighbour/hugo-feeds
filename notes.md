If the content of the story in the feed has an img element with a webfeedsFeaturedVisual classname, that image will be selected as the featured image.

If the first img in the story has a height and width greater than 450 pixels, that first image will be selected as the featured image. If not, Feedly will try to pick the largest image in the story.
